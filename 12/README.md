Got part 1 on my own, and even wrote a theoretically-working part 2. Tried to get Memoize working in perl to no avail, then gave up for the day.

Followed this tutorial: https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18hbjdi/2023_day_12_part_2_this_image_helped_a_few_people/

It helped me see I was on the right track, but also in the 10 days since I basically gave up on Perl and started using Python. I borrowed their part 1 code rather than rewrite everything myself, then modified the example to make part 2 work.
