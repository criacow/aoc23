I spent hours and hours on the 17th on this, trying to adapt an a_star_search algorithm to the task. I got close but could never quite get it to work.

A few days later, I solved this thanks to this tutorial:

I understood the entire tutorial and what the writer was doing, so I'm counting that as a win. I'm including the fragmented attempts at solutions in case I ever try to pick it back up, but honestly it would be better to trash it and start over.
