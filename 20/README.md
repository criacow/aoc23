I got part 1 on my own, then spent basically all day trying to figure out part 2. I knew it was an LCM problem, and knew what inputs to get, but for whatever reason I couldn't get the right data out of my solution. I even tried iterating for 24h to find the right pulses.

So I read this tutorial: https://github.com/mebeim/aoc/blob/master/2023/README.md#day-20---pulse-propagation

and that helped me figure out part 2.
